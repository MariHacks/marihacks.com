            Mentor registration will open very soon! MariHacks is open to
            programmers of any level, and we encourage participants to try out
            new programming fields and techniques! That being said, our
            hackathon strives to inspire learning, innovation and collaboration,
            which would not be possible without mentors. If you are an
            experienced programmer in one or more domains who loves to help
            others, we would love to have you!
