            Judging registration will open very soon! Based on the judging
            criteria for the submissions, judges would bring their expert
            insights in order to select the winners. Thus, if you are a
            professional in the field of programming or have a professional
            background of working with hackathons, MariHacks would love to
            welcome you as a judge for our event!
