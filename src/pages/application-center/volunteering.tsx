            Volunteer registration will open very soon! MariHacks is run by a
            small team of Marianopolis students, and the event would not be as
            fun or even possible without our amazing volunteers! If you are a
            CEGEP student interested in helping out and you are available during
            some parts or the entirety of MariHacks (see our schedule), donâ€™t
            hesitate to sign up to volunteer!
